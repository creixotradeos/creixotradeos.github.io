Most investors are continually attempt to discover a solution to a basic question, _What is the movement of the market in the future_.

Fundamentally speaking, nobody can infallibly claim to accurately answer that question. That is why the majority of investors and analyst go through a really long effort attempting to estimate the future of an assest's price. One of tools to do this is using **Python** languange to assist in analyzing large amount of data of the stock market.

In this article, we will write a script that will allow us to:

 - Get market data with Python and Pandas package
 - Determine the daily return of the stock
 - Plot the daily return with a chart
 - Simulate the movement of the stock price in the future with Monte Carlo Simulation
